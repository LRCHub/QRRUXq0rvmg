# LE SSERAFIM – Come Over

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
No lying when it feels right
Stop trying baby listen
No hiding what it feels like
Don’t play me like a rhythm
And I’m crying out for anything
And the
thought of something else
Oh I know you want to
take my hand
So come over come over and dance
So come over
come over
come over that
Come over
come over and dance
So come over
come over
come over that
Come over
come over and dance
No lying when it feels right
Stop trying baby listen
No hiding what it feels like
Don’t play me like a rhythm
And I’m crying out for anything
And the
thought of something else
Oh I know you want to
take my hand
So come over come over and dance
So come over
come over
come over that
Come over
come over and dance
So come over
come over
come over that
Come over
come over and dance
And I’m crying out for anything
And the
thought of something else
Oh I know you want to
take my hand
So come over come over and dance
So come over
come over
come over that
Come over
come over and dance
So come over
come over
come over that
Come over
come over and dance
