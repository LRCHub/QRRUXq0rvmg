It's been a crazy time for us
Of pushing all our limits
Snapping necks and breaking balls
Now you'd have done the same
But you were baking biscuits
While I went, bent the law
Sacrificing something
As you counted all my flaws

Why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
And walk in my shoes

You wanna live freely
Don't wanna die
You want it? You got it
You chase the high
You wanna be out there
You wanna race
You wanna take over
Just gotta play

Why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
And walk in my shoes

I'm a good person
Don't wanna fight with no one
But you piss me off
You keep pushing, pushing
You'd best step of the gas, boy
All bets are off, fuck you
You taste like toxic poison
I wash my hands of you

Why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
Why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
So why don't you come over?
And walk in my shoes
Walk in my shoes

Ha!
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you?
Cut it
