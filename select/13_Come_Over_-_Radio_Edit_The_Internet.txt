Know you wrong
But showyou right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won't
Worth a try

Puppy love
Butterflies
Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby, you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time

You're beautiful, babe
You're really something
Stylin' I gotta say
T-shirt, designer jeans
You got me open
Filled with emotion
Living in ecstacy
Just want you next to me

I'll bring the champagne
Don't turn me down babe
We can play Simon Says
Or watch TV in bed
Wake with the sunrise
Sleep in, it's alright
Ain't even gotta sex

Mmm but, I know what you like, baby
Can I come over, come over
You're wasting your time, baby

If you just let me come over, babe
If you just let me come over, babe

Know you wrong
But show you right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won't
Worth a try, hey

Puppy love
Butterflies
Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time

Tryna tell her like

If you just let me come over babe
If you just let me come over babe

Know you wrong
But 'sho you right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won't
Worth a try
Puppy love
Butterflies
Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time
